create-repack-app crypto-ticker --full

rails g model coin cmc_id name symbol price last_fetched:datetime
rails g model watched_coin user:belongs_to coin:belongs_to initial_price

in user.rb:

  has_many :watched_coins, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :coins, through: :watched_coins

  ^^^ This sets up the through table relationship, so we can just do "user.coins"

then in coin.rb:

  has_many :watched_coins, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :users, through: :watched_coins

  ^^^ This completes the through-table relationship, so coin has_many users, and user has_many coins

rails g controller api/coins index create show update destroy --skip-routes

added gems:
  pry
  rack-cors
  httparty

before_action :authenticate_user!
  ^^^ ALLOWS THE USE OF current_user

match = res[0].with_indifferent_access
  lets you use a string or a symbol to access a key in a hash

building actions now. we're gonna let them handle api calls.

build some sweet charts with ReCharts!

yarn add recharts
